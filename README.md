# pytorch-binary-classification

Welcome to the PyTorch Binary Classification project(csv data)! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build and train a binary classification model using PyTorch. Whether you're new to PyTorch or looking for a refresher, this tutorial will guide you through the essential steps of creating a binary classifier.

## Overview

Binary classification is a fundamental task in machine learning where the goal is to classify instances into one of two classes. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Defining the neural network architecture
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages via pip:

``` bash
pip install -r req.txt

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Artin200912/pytorch-binary-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd pytorch-binary-classification
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open and run the `Binary_Classification_Tutorial.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

For this project, you need to follow along with your own dataset, because the project is fonfigured for any csv dataset

## Notebook Structure
